After cloning the repository, you can open the `index.html` file in your favourite browser to see how it might look.
If your computer is offline you might see some broken images as we're using placeholders from [fillmurray.com](http://fillmurray.com).

Alternatively a hosted version is available on GitHub pages at [https://thisislawatts.github.io/snyk-exercise/](https://thisislawatts.github.io/snyk-exercise/)
